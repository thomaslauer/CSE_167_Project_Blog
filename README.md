#### Project Description:

Our project will be to recreate a Bob Ross style picture using realtime graphics. 
Many of his paintings are landscapes, with dramatic mountains, serene lakes, and fluffy clouds.
It's a good challenge to see if we can not only implement the code, but make it integrate together in a 
visually appealing way. 
We will implement functionality to randomize the entire scene, so you can have a never ending supply of free paintings. 
In addition, the first person controls will let you fly around the landscape to see it from different angles. 

#### Techinal Features:

Feature | Points
--- | ---
Procedurally generated terrain | 2 Points
Water with realistic waves and reflections | 3 Points
Procedural generated and animated clouds | 2 Points
Procedurally generated plants with L-systems  | 2 Points
First person camera controls | 1 Point

Total: 10 Points (9 if we use water without reflections)

#### Creative Effort:
Our creative effort will be focused on tuning the elements of our scene to make them match realistically.


#### Inspiration images:
This is a good painting showing all the elements we want to implement (minus the cabin)

And here's a sketch we made. Don't judge us, we're not artists.
